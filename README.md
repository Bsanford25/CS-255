# CS-255
The system in this project was for a company called DriverPass, whose objective is to provide study guides, practice tests, and in-person driving lessons
 for people looking to pass their driving tests. I feel as though I did a good job on the Power Point presentation and the activity diagrams, while I could
 have done a better job on the UML user case diagrams. If I could go back and make a revision, I would edit the UML user case diagrams. In doing that, I would
 take out the payment processor actor and add a few more use cases for the admin, such as disabling packages. I interpreted the user's needs by reading the 
 interview transcript multiple times and thinking like the customer. For example, I thought in terms of, if I had paid for this service/product, what would 
 I expect from it? I implented the user's needs by including the requirements that were mentioned in the interview into the system plans in a simple easy to 
 use way. It is crucial to consider and understand the user's needs when designing a system because the user is the one who will determine if the system satisfies 
 their needs. This, ultimately determines if the project is successful in my opinion because if the users dont like the system, or are uncomfortable using it, they
 likely won't. I approach designing software using a step-by-step, agile, approach. First, considering the requirements of the system and coming up with a plan on how to 
 go about meeting them and dividing the workload. Using an agile methodology is a strategy that has been proven successful and allows for the division of the workload based on the team's strenghs. This allows team members to focus on what they are good at and establishes who is responsible for each aspect of the project.
